\subsect{Lecture 3 - Dr Peter Hatto, Head of Research and Development at Ionbond}

Along with Dr Peter Hatto's role at Ionbond he has previously chaired multiple technical committees on the subject of nanotechnology standardisation.
These include committees \emph{ISO/TC 229}, \emph{CEN/TC 352} and \emph{BSI/NTI/1} preparing such standards as \emph{ISO 10808:2010 Nanotechnologies -- Characterization of nanoparticles in inhalation exposure chambers for inhalation toxicity testing}~\cite{iso10808}.
An International Standardisation Organisation (ISO) Technical Committee (TC) is structured, similarly to most ISO/TC, with a chairman coordinating many Working Groups (WGs) followed by Task Groups(TGs).
Figure~\ref{figure:tc229} describes the hierarchy of ISO/TC 229.

Standards enable modern living by seamlessly allowing not only advanced technology enterprises, like Oyster cards, to work within common space but also basic product design like \emph{ISO 9407} regarding shoe sizes.
These are a set of rules that can be opted into by businesses who then agree to conform to said standard, they are not imposed like regulations.
Agreeing to standardisation can be a catalyst for technological development but also a resistive force if ill-posed.  
This involves controlling four areas regarding the technology:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Interoperability
	\item Quality
	\item Variety reduction/optimisation
	\item Information/measurement
\end{itemize}

Exploitation of standardisation can improve profits.
Not directly but by opening a more horizontal business model.
For example standardising processes in manufacture increases productivity through increased familiarisation, improves quality control and enables outsourcing or removal of outsourcing~\cite{pasquire2001standards}.
As standards are optional rules they may not be required to contribute to projects tied with government but would certainly aid any contract bids.
