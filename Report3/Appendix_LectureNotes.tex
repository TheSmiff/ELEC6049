Alstom - Fabrice Perot

MD Alstom Grid Research and Technology Centre

Alstom 130 years old. Emerged from General Electric Company in the UK. Alstom 

made up of four sectors; thermal power, transport, renewable power and grid. All 

four sectors are present in the UK. Alstom Gid section based in stafford. Power 

transformers are built at a large factory in Stafford. They also make HVDC transformers 

there. Instrument transformers, circuitbreakers and disconnectors and gas insulated 

substations (GIS) are also manufactured and design within Alstom Grid but not 

necessarily at Stafford. In Stafford the R and D for HVDC power electronics and 

offshore substations are investigated. They also design substation automation 

solutions or relays and controls as it used to be called.

5 research and development centres with 4\% of Alstom sales being reinvested in 

Alstom Grid R\&D. 1200 skilled engineers working on R\&D challenges including HVDC, 

UHVDC and Smart Grid techniques. Experts in final element modelling and have 

developed their own unique software for FEM calculations.

The core competency of Alstom Grid is in High Voltage and Dielectric Materials. They 

are experts in developing materials that are largely non-porous to prevent voids. 

Glass fibre materials are an example of this. This helps to avoid partial discharge in 

the material which can eventually lead to breakdown. Some of these materials are 

employed in different industries and settings, such as the Eurostar, T45 Destroyers and 

the Astute Submarines. The applications of this research are quite wide ranging.

Funding is also taken on colaborative projects from the public purse. The EU HORIZON 

2020 policy is one such source of funding for HV research. The technology strategy 

board funds ``catapults'' to try and deploy innovation as a product. National Grid, 

Scottish Power and Scottish and Southern Electric are transmition system operators 

that can gain access to funding through Ofgem and a new funding system called RIIO 

- Revenue = Incentives + Innovation + Outputd. The RIIO is comprised of the Network 

Innovation Allowance, Network Innovation Competitions and the Low Carbon Network 

Fund. These are just some of the levers available.

\textbf{Energy Policy}

80\% reduction of 1990 CO2 levels by 2050 and 34\% by 2022. Renewables to supply 

15\% of UK energy by 2020. UK achieves about 3\% currently. This is not a very long 

time in the power industry. Road transport and energy efficiency is important. The 

energy trilemma is key - security, economics and emissions. The Climate Change Act 

2008 and the Energy Act 2008 are key with chapters 27 and 32 respectively being the 

chapters with the figures in them.

In order for this to take place, the complexity of the distribution network must 

increase. Energy world consumption is likely to increase by 50\% between 2007 to 

2035. A huge increase in renewables is required while a huge reduction in the very 

large fossil fuel powered stations.

One of the European wide strategies is increased interconnection. There are vast 

renewable resources, including huge amounts of wind in the North Sea, Hydro in 

Norway and a massive amount of thermal solar in the North of Africa. The distances 

involved are very large, with thousands of kilometres from the renewable concentrates 

to the load centres. One of the ways of distributing this power is through HVDC rather 

than the AC networks currently prevalent throughout distribution. Clearly there are 

large techical challenges and massive political challenges in dealing with instability in 

North Africa for the Solar. The wind however is a different story. The distances can be 

up to 3000km, which AC transmission would simply not be cost effective. There are 

numerous plans to start harnessing North Sea power and there are a few already in 

deployment. These projects are very capital intensive - 100 millions of euros and can 

cost Alstom dearly if the small weather window is missed to deploy the technology.

\textbf{Why Do We Need HVDC?}

Thomas Edison proposed DC and George Westinghouse proposed AC. Westinghouse 

won due to the difficulties with DC. Transformers for DC do not exist and made it very 

difficult to step up the voltage for long distance transmission. For HVDC, you start with 

an AC power source and put it through a big rectifier bridge. Then you transmit the 

HVDC power over the cables, then you change it back to AC at the other end. Several 

types of link exist. Back to back links allow asynchronous connection, allowing 50Hz 

and 60Hz networks to be connected. Point to Point is the same but has an Over Head 

Line (OHL) for bulk transmission over distance. Point to Point schemes also exist in 

submarine versions, where the cable is subsea and this is used for the connection of 

wind farms in the North Sea. AC power is continuously charging and discharging the 

capacitive impedance in the cable, resulting in large reactive power consumption. The 

DC version only charges the impedance once (like a resistance) so the consumption 

is much less over long distances. The HVDC scheme between France and the UK 

was extremely successful, it paid for itself in just 3 years and achieves over 97\% 

availability. 

Another aspect of AC is space. AC for a double circuit would require six large cables - 

requiring a big tunnel for heat dissipation. DC requires only one for a monopolar link 

or two for a bipolar link, thus saving space. DC cables also produce less heat.

AC systems require reactive compensation in the form of FACTS (Flexible AC 

Transmission System) over long distances. Even though DC converter stations cost alot 

of money, they do not require periodic compensation. Thus over a very long distances, 

there is a distance break-even point where HVDC becomes cheaper than AC. This is 

around 30 miles for underground or submarine systems and around 500 miles for 

OHLs.

The power rectifier is usually a 12 pulse connection. This is a six pulse grid connection 

utilising 6 thyristors to produce a DC voltage. You can put two six pulse bridges 

together to produce a twelve pulse bridge to allow more power to be put in the system. 

You can then add two of these twelve pulse bridges together, to allow one for V+ and 

one for V-. In China these run at +\-800kV and allow 5000-6000 MW to be transmitted 

down just two wires. This is a huge amount of power.

The key technology is thyristor technology that enables this HVDC connection. A huge 

amount of tehcnology is invested in these systems. There are also VSCs (Voltage Source 

Converters) which are a series of capacitors in series with the AC, and a set of insulated 

gate transistors (IGCT) which switch the capacitors in and out. These are called multi-
level converters. This technology is very useful for renewable energy connection.

Thyristor valves are usually arranged in quadrivalves. The Alstom H400 valve modules 

provide two stacks of thyristors in series. These are watercooled. Thyristor technology 

is interesting because they fail short circuit. So they build in redundancy. Every two 

years, the HVDC system undergoes maintenance. Each H400 module is arranged in 

fours to make a quadrivalve and then there are six of these in a twelve pulse bridge. 

These are suspended from the ceiling for seismic reasons.

In early 2000s, HVDC was largely a curiosity. In China and other large countries, there 

was a huge renaissance in HVDC technology. 800kV is the standard voltage for HVDC in 

China. India is building it's first 800kV HVDC scheme, although it is only 2.5GW capacity 

compared to the huge ones in China. In the late 80s, the Brazillian Itaupu Hydro dam 

was the highest voltage introduced by ABB at 600kV. In China they are starting to think 

about +\-1.1MV. Although Fabrice thinks this is probably uneconomic.

One of the highest power schemes was in China. The Ningdong-Shandong +\-660kV 

scgene was built. It is the world's largest single power electronic converter at 2GW. 

4 converters in total, 2 at each end. It was built in pairs of valves not in quadrivalves. 

These were all tested in the lab at full scale before deployment. These are very big 

pieces of kit. The HVDC centre of excellence in Stafford produced a very large power 

transformer suitable for these huge amounts of power.

A Line Commutated Current HVDC station at Chandrapur 2x500MW back to back 

station in India has a small building to hous ethe thyristors, but 440mx530m is 

required to filter the high frequency harmonics from the system.

\textbf{Nanotechnology}

Advantages available for both AC and DC technologies. Cigre D1-40 WG Functional 

Nanomaterials for Electric Power Industry was a technical brochure published at the 

end of 2013. Nanotechnolog could improve the performance of dielectrics massively, 

increasing safety and economics. 

There is an issue understanding how the dispersion of micro and nano fillers act within 

epoxy matrices. We need to understand how to make reproducible materials and try to 

understand how this works and what benefits can be offered. An important research 

area is the improvement of thermal conductivity while maintaining electrical resistivity. 

If thermal conductivity can be increased bya factor, then the size of equipment can 

be vastly reduced. Diamond is the example of this is nature. It has very good thermal 

conductivity while remaining electrcially insulative. Boron Nitride is another interesting 

material that could be a candidate to improve dielectric strength while improving 

thermal conductivity.

Epoxy-Alumina nanocomposites show promise in resisting surface discharge. Often 

pollution and impurities and imperfections in the insulating material can cause partial 

discharge in the form of surface discharge. The 3\% nano filler material can resist 

surface discharge for extreme periods.

The Technology Strategy Board funds the Alstom project, NanocompEIM. Around 20 

engineers working together. It costs around a million euro for 30 months, and about 

half of it is covered by the TSB. They are tackling the increased dielectric strength 

while increasing thermal conductivity problem. Today they can make small quantities 

of nano-materials, but they are trying to develop ways to mass manufacture when 

proven. The upscale is the objective of the project. The TSB require reporting and a 

focus on the deployment and demonstration of the technology.

\textbf{The BIG Multi Disciplinary Challenge}

A huge amount of innovation is required to meet the energy challenge in all 

engineering disciplines. Mechnicals, electronics, controls\dots there is loads of 

opportunities. A huge amount of investment is required. The Government is setting out 

more provision for these types of challenges to be met.

Will we see the planned expansion in HVDC multi-terminals systems in Europe in 

our lifetime?

\textbf{Questions}

What currents do you transmit at? The issue with DC is that the current never goes 

through zero, so the magnitude is not the problem, it is the fact it is not cyclic. Multi-
terminal systems require very quick acting circuit breakers. The DC current for the 

Chinese projects was around 4000-5000 amps. This pushes all the connections as far as 

possible (6250A is around the maximum). DC is perhaps more dangerous as DC burns 

you while AC stops your heart - which is worse?!?

Are the 20:20:20 goals realistic? What are the financial motives in a private market? 

We need to achieve it - the consequences of climate change could be catastrophic. 

The finance is a huge issue. The economic climate is a big issue. Huge investment is 

required. We need investment banks to be more positive.

If you removed the subsidies from EU and government policies, would Alstom or any 

other power equipment manufacturer be profitable? The financing of the R\&D is 

an issue for governments. These require the finding mechanisms from government. 

The large HVDC schemes are commercial entities, and alot of money can be made 

in the private market for new transmission systems. You need to spend money as a 

company in innovation to continue profitability. These funding schemes are important 

to providing that lifeline. These could be viewed more as a stimulus, the Horizon 2020 

schemes is of the order 70 billion euro. It is quite important therefore that these 

continue, but perhaps this is since electricity is vital, if intel's chip R\&D halted, we 

would probably be OK for a short while.

What about itnegrating micro generation in the grid and how invested is Alstom 

in meeting governement targets? Innovation is required throughout the industry. 

Even in AC, work is undertaken to leakproof SF6 systems and ultimately to find a 

non-greenhouse effect insulating Gas. Also mineral oil coolant for transformers 

contaminates the ground in the event of a leak, and burns in an accident. Research 

into vegetable oil coolants could be useful if regulations change to disallow or penalise 

mineral oils (or SF6 mentioned prior). There is a huge amount of innovation required 

and Alstom is constantly trying to stay one step ahead of the crowd.
