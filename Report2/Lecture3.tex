\subsect{Lecture 3 - Iain Gavin \& Amazon Web Services}

Amazon is, without any reasonable doubt, an established company.
Founded by Jeff Bezos in 1994 the company shipped their first book in July 1995~\cite{seattle}.
The company now has three different parallel business interests.
The original retail aspect, the 3$^{rd}$ party selling service via the website and Amazon Web Services (AMS).
AMS acts as a business accelerator by removing the requirement for on-site IT solutions.
They achieve this by maintaining large sever farms from which computing power can be \emph{rented} to facilitate the IT needs of a company.
They also provide varying degrees of cloud based storage; subject to access latency.
