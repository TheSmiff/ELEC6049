1.0	&	Chair	&	The group decided that HSL should be the chair for this report. AJR is still pursuing job applications and will hence chair the final report. 	&   -	 \\ \hline
2.0	&	Feedback & The feedback from the first report was good. The group have decided to look more at strategy rather than the history of a company. & - \\ \hline
3.0 & Start Up Company & A definition from literature is needed as to how to classify a start up company. All are to look for ideas. &  \textbf{ALL A1.0} \\ \hline

4.0 & Initial Ideas & Good ideas make money in a start up. However, how does one define a ``good'' idea? What drives desirability for products. & - \\ \hline
5.0 & Kickstarter & Kickstarter was deemed unproductive - it is not how a start up makes money, mearly a mechanism for excelling good ideas & - \\ \hline
6.0 & Hypothesis 1 & Need a good idea and a good market. HSL raised point of RAMBUS which was both a good idea and had a good market, but was unsuccessful due to poor management decisions. Also unknown if this was a start up at the time, and if this even applies to the hypothesis suggested. & - \\ \hline
7.0 & Hypothesis 2 & Patents, publicity or trade secrets. Start ups that manage to get patents for a desirable technology, whether it is applicable at the time or future, could become desirable to larger companies to fund. HSL raised example of Quantum Research Group who were bought out by Atmel. & - \\ \hline

8.0 & Deadline & TJS raised that the deadline is 3 weeks today - 25th March. & - \\ \hline

9.0 & Research & Ideas have been raised, but TJS suggested we research and have a clear starting point and idea before looking at the case studies. Due to Zepler outage, disabling most of us doing most other work, more effort will be put into this module this week to compensate & \textbf{ALL 2.0} \\ \hline

10.0 & Git & Git has proved useful. A new report template is to be set up. & \textbf{HSL 3.0} \\ \hline

11.0 & Next meeting & Group decided to meet \textbf{5th March} as no one can do other work so will concentrate on this. & - \\ \hline

1.0	&	House Keeping	&	The minutes of the last meeting were adopted by the group								&	- \\ \hline
2.0 	&	Research	&	The research done was interesting. A few papers were found about strategy with a discussion of patents. TJS 6\% of start ups have a novel idea. HSL found a paper saying that Independent Ventures are more successful than Corporate ventures. TJS - Kodak held patents for digital cameras, but didn't persue because of destruction to the current film camera maret.  & - \\ \hline
3.0	&	Hypothesis 1 	& 	Does a start up need an initial good idea?	& - \\ \hline
4.0 	&	Hypothesis 2 	&	Is the early acquisition of patents key to the success of a start up? & - \\ \hline
5.0	&	Hypothesis 3	&	Is it better to be a corporate venture or an independent venture? & - \\ \hline
6.0	&	Discussion	& 	3 was declined as not much literature was found. 1 opens up for a large discussion about why. We also know the answer already. It's very subjective - what is a `good idea'? It is also more difficult to break up into 3 parts of work. 2 - more focussed. Would be a similar layout to previous report in section 2. Easy definition of terms. However, conclusion could be open ended as we don't know the answer! & - \\ \hline
7.0	&	Other points	&	TJS - Section 2 could be areas of technology, rather than specific companies. HSL - big companies were once start ups, and were successful. Might be worth looking at their early years. AJR - conclusion may be difficult as we make differing points. Suggested the starting of a `common themes' document. & \textbf{ALL A4.0} \\ \hline
8.0	& 	Introduction	&	HSL to begin introduction. Define the hypothesis and the terms used - `start up', `successful' etc\dots & \textbf{HSL 5.0} \\ \hline
9.0	&	Research	&	AJR and TJS to start case studies research & \textbf{AJR TJS 6.0} \\ \hline
6.0	&	Minutes		&	The group agreed that HSL would collate these minutes.			& \textbf{HSL A7.0} \\ \hline
7.0	&	AOB		&	Group to attend tutorial on the 11th March. AJR unable to attend due to job interview. Therefore the next meeting will take place 11:00 Wednesday 12th March, in Zepler Level 3 labs . The meeting was closed. & - \\ \hline

1.0	&	House Keeping	&	The minutes of the last meeting were adopted by the group								&	- \\ \hline
2.0	&	Nest		&	TJS had completed a first draft of the Nest Case study. Shows a company who had valuable patents and was successful. HSL had proof read it. Agreed it was a good study.	&	- \\ \hline
2.1	&	Nanotech	&	TJS had collated the lecture notes from Gary Steele. Done extra research into one of Steele's companies, looking into patents. Deemed good idea and a similar structure to be kept for the other lecture notes.	HSL to do this for Parker's notes looking at a company	&	\textbf{HSL A8.0} \\ \hline
2.2	&	Atmel		&	HSL done a outline of the Atmel case study. AJR raised an interesting point as if they would have been successful if they chose to fight their case. Outline looks good. Needs completion. &	\textbf{ HSL A9.0} \\ \hline
3.0	&	Final Study	&	Need to find a third case study. Ideally one which failed and look if this links to patent acquisitions. Maybe look into Steele's and Parker's history to help find. Or look at VC funded ventures.  &	\textbf{AJR A10.0} \\ \hline
4.0	&	Introduction 	&	Introduction needs completing with more info about patents.						&	\textbf{HSL A11.0 } \\ \hline
5.0	&	Conclusion   	&	Need to begin conclusion. TJS to start an outline of it for HSL to complete once studies are done.	&	\textbf{TJS A12.0; HSL A12.1} \\ \hline
6.0	&	Patent Matrix	&	TJS raised that we can classify into four categories - Patent-Success, Patent-Failure, No patents-Success, No patents-Failure. Decided to use this to show different methods and can add an arbitrary scale to show strengths.			& \textbf{HSL A13.0} \\ \hline
7.0	&	Minutes		&	The group agreed that HSL would collate these minutes.			& \textbf{HSL A14.0} \\ \hline
