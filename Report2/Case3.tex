In 1998 Iridium, a separate company spawned by Motorola in 1991, launched their telecommunications service to the public.
In 1999 Iridium filed for bankruptcy.
The company started a ground breaking Low Earth Orbiting (LEO) satellite network which was made possible by a total \$$5$ billion investment from Motorola.
Expanding on existing mobile phone technology by offering global connections without delays.
Satellite technology is extremely complex and the seven years before release was spent designing, constructing and launching the network~\cite{fink2000iridium}. 
It is widely agreed that the failure of the company can be attributed to the expensive handsets and call tariffs.
Initially they managed to attract less than half the number of expected customers and these fell quickly as issues with the handsets arose~\cite{bill1999}.
