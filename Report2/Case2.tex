Brief intro to atmel.
Show that the clasify as a blossoming company during the time we are looking at.

Actually had a patent infringement with Intel over EPROM memory. 

Forced them to redesign and come up with a better technology

Atmel then later got patents

Also used Venture Capital to encourage the business.


Need to find early patent applications to verify if they had any around the start up time.
