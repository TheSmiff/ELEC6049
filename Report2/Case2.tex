\todo{Brief intro to atmel.}
\todo{Show that the clasify as a blossoming company during the time we are looking at.}
Atmel Technologies was founded in 1984 by a former Intel employee, George Perlegos.
They were venture capital funded, with only \$30,000 in initial investment.
Atmel in the current day are a very well established company, with offices in many different countries, multiple product ranges and had a turn over of \$150.93 million in the last quarter of 2013 \cite{atmel:profit}.

Atmel hold many patents as of 2014. 
However, their first patent was issued on
Actually had a patent infringement with Intel over EPROM memory. 

Forced them to redesign and come up with a better technology

Atmel then later got patents

Also used Venture Capital to encourage the business.

Need to find early patent applications to verify if they had any around the start up time.
