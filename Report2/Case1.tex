\subsect{Nest Labs - Patents for protection and adding value}

Nest Labs was founded in May 2010 by Tony Fadell and Matt Rogers \cite{nestcompany}.
The company designs innovative smoke alarms and thermostats that feature iterative learning and are internet connected.
The company has a strong design ethos.
Many employees are ex-Apple, including co-founder and CEO Tony Fadell who is accredited as the father of the Apple iPod \cite{reuters}.
The company was acquired by Google for \$3.2bn cash \cite{reuters} in February 2014.
Although the company has not yet existed for 8 years, the acquisition by Google makes Nest Labs a successful emerging company.
This case-study will examine the acquisition by Google and ascertain the role patents in this emerging company.
