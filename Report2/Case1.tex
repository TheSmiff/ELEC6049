\subsect{Nest Labs - Patents for protection and adding value}

Nest Labs was founded in May 2010 by Tony Fadell and Matt Rogers \cite{NestFactsheet}.
The company designs innovative smoke alarms and thermostats that feature iterative learning and are internet connected.
From humble beginnings, Nest have now sold 14m thermostats and 50m smoke alarms and employ over 300 people \cite{NestFactsheet}.
The company was acquired by Google for \$3.2bn cash \cite{NestReuters} in February 2014 \cite{NestFactsheet}.
Although the company has not yet existed for 8 years, the acquisition by Google makes Nest Labs a successful emerging company.
This case-study will examine the acquisition by Google and ascertain the criticality of patents to the success of this emerging company.

Nest has a strong design heritage, both co-founders were ex-Apple employees and CEO Tony Fadell is widely accredited as the father of the Apple iPod \cite{NestAppleInsider}.
Many Nest employees are also Apple alums \cite{NestReuters}.
This includes Richard `Chip' Lutton, appointed as Vice President and general counsel in 2012 \cite{NestAppleInsider}, who was heavily involved in Apple's patent strategy \cite{NestReuters}.
Nest has a somewhat unusual patent strategy for an emerging company.
Before the Google acquisition Nest had already settled 100 patent disputes \cite{NestCoLabs}.
It also owns 200 patents and has another 200 ready to file \cite{NestCoLabs, NestIV}.
The company signed an agreement with Intellectual Ventures in September 2013 granting access to IV's 40,000 strong patent portfolio \cite{NestIV}.
This is an aggressive approach to patenting, which is not normally pursued by an independent emerging company due to the legal costs \cite{zahra1996technology}.
The expertise gained through some of the employees experience at Apple must play a role in Nest's patenting strategy.

\emph{Tony Fadell - ``At Nest, what we did was make sure that we are putting [effort in] a ton of patents. This is what you have to do to disrupt major revenue streams.''} \cite{NestCoLabs}
