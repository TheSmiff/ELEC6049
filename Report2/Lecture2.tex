\subsect{Lecture 2 -  David Parker \& Perpetuum}


\inote{Give a brief intro to them}
Perpetuum are a Southampton based business specialising in energy harvesting modules. 
They were founded in 20xx\todo{Need to find when Perpetuum were founded} as they began life as a component supplier for their module.
Perpetuum satisfy the criteria for being an emerging company; they were established less than eight years ago, and they are still a private company. 

%\inote{Show Perpetuum is a start up.}

\inote{Discuss patent acquisitions of Perpetuum}


\inote{Discuss that even though they had patents, they were in the wrong market.}

\inote{Now they are in a good market, their patents are protecting them and they are doing well.
Define ``well''. 
Are they established yet?}

\inote{Parker briefly spoke about that software is difficult to patent, but hardware is very effective. 
Results in us looking at hardware companies rather than software.}
