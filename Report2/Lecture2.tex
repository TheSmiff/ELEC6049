Perpetuum are a Southampton based business specialising in energy harvesting modules. 
They were founded in 2004 and they began life as a component supplier for their power module.

They are a venture capital funded start-up involving multiple companies.
%\inote{Show Perpetuum is a start up.}

\inote{Discuss patent acquisitions of Perpetuum}
%http://patents.justia.com/assignee/perpetuum-ltd?page=2
Perpetuum currently hold 22 patents to date. 
Their first was issued on the 23rd August, 2007, some 3 years after they began.

\inote{Discuss that even though they had patents, they were in the wrong market.}

\inote{Now they are in a good market, their patents are protecting them and they are doing well.
Define ``well''. 
Are they established yet?}

\inote{Parker briefly spoke about that software is difficult to patent, but hardware is very effective. 
Results in us looking at hardware companies rather than software.}
