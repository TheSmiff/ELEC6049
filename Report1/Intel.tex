\subsect{Intel Corporation}

Intel is a pioneering company in the field of microprocessor design and fabrication.
Founded in 1968 by Bob Noyce and Gordon Moore~\cite{IntelHistory}; the man behind the self fulfilling prophecy known as Moore's law - "The number of transistors incorporated in a chip will approximately double every 24 months."~\cite{IntelMoore}.
Starting off with memory chips their first microprocessor, and the first commercially available microprocessor, was released in November 1971.
Although the technology was emerging the founders were already well established.
Members of the "The Traitorous Eight" who created the west coast silicon industry from which direct links can be made to many well established companies~\cite{Eight}; including Atmel.
The two experienced engineers had already made a mark in Fairchild semiconductor~\cite{Fairchild} and were backed by a \$2.5 million investment from Aurthur Rock~\cite{IntelStartup}.

A case study taken from \cite{johnson2008exploring} considers Intel as moving through three eras.
The first was involvement in the memory market followed by the second with huge successes in microprocessors.
The third era, possibly still their current drive, is moving focus away from the desktop market towards low power devices from the modern home.
The end of the second era coincides with their highest every share price at the beginning of the 21$^{st}$ century then dropping rapidly shortly after and remaining below 50\% of the peak value up until this day~\cite{IntelStock}.

What is the reason for this relative failure?
Diversification is a possible factor as the company may have failed to do this early enough.
Competitors in the processor market, such as ARM, came out of nowhere.
Their low power designs were suitable for the emerging portable digital electronics revolution on the horizon.
Intel's architecture had been growing in complexity over many years and changes for this market required serious alterations.
They did eventually adapt which may explain their continuing success but this left a gap in the processor market.
