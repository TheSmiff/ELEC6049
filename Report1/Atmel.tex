\subsect{Atmel Technologies Ltd.}

Atmel Technologies Ltd are a leading company in the design and manufacture of a variety of product areas. 
The company was founded in 1984 by George Perlegos in the USA, a former Intel employee. 
It started with only \$ 30,000 in capital \cite{atmel:capital} and made \$150.93 million profit in Q4 of 2013 alone \cite{atmel:profit}.
The company also has it's stocks in the NASDAQ \cite{atmel:nasdaq}.
Atmel satisfies the criteria for being an established company - it has been successful for many years, and has a defined product range.
This case study will give a brief overview of the company, including an investigation into the diversity of Atmel, and whether this diversity has helped the success of the company.



Atmel's original product range was in non-volatile memory devices, primarily EEPROM memory.
Atmel sold it's memory devices to companies such as Nokia and Motorola.
However, in 1987, Intel sued Atmel.
Intel claimed the Atmel had infringed their patent, and Atmel did not fight the case \cite{atmel:intel}.
Instead of spending time and money on the law suit, Atmel redesigned their memory devices and came up with a new design which turned out to have better performance and consumed less power than the Intel equivalent.
As well as beating Intel in the EEPROM market, Atmel entered the flash memory market and out competed Intel there too.
The patent case forced Atmel to redesign it's product, and can be seen as a, albeit small, diversification.
This resulted in a much better product than Intel, giving Atmel the edge in the market.


Since entering the memory market, Atmel also began to branch out to other markets. 
Atmel licensed an architecture from ARM to begin their microcontroller industry.
Since then, Atmel opened a branch in Norway to develop the AVR RISC architecture.
The company then combined their memory devices, both flash and EEPROM, with their AVR devices and the first microcontroller was released in 1996.

Not only did Atmel branch into relevant markets, but the company also acquired many other companies during their growth. They also bought foundaries from companies. 
Not only did the company gain different product areas, but they also sold parts of the company over time too. 
This raises the argument that too much diversification could be bad.
All acquisitions and sales are outlined below in chronological order and were found from \cite{atmel:acq1, atmel:acq2}

\begin{enumerate}

\item[1996] Acquired European Silicon Structures and Digital Research in Electronic Acoustics.
\item[1998] purchased a part of TEMIC, a discrete semiconductor manufacturer. Included two fabs in France and Germany.
\item[2000] Purchased a fab in North Tyneside from Siemens
\item[2007] Sold fab in North Tyneside
\item[2008] Sold fab in Germany
\item[2008] Acquired Quantum Research Group to enter touch screen industry
\item[2010] Sold fab in France
\item[2011] Sold D.R.E.A.M. 
\item[2012] Sold DataFlash products
\item[2012] Acquired Ozmo Devices who made Wi-Fi products.
\item[2013] Acquired Smart Metering products from IDT Corporation
\item[FIND] Acquired Advanced Digital Design S.A who specialised in communications with power lines
\end{enumerate}
