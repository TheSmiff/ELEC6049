\subsect{ARM - John Biggs - Consultant Engineer and Co-Founder}
%Overview of each of the talks and an assessment of the information presented in light of the report topic 'How does technology make profit?' 
ARM was founded in 1990 in Cambridge, U.K. as a result of a joint venture between Apple, Acorn and VLSI.
The primary function of ARM was to design processor architectures, but not to manufacture them.
ARM's business model involved the licensing of architectures, as opposed to the sale. 
This also included income from royalties which funded the next products.
They are now the world's leading semiconductor IP company and have shipped 50 billion devices to date.

ARM were able to grasp the low power market ahead of larger CPU firms such as Intel. 
This gave ARM an advantage in the mobile age as it increased battery life of smartphones and tablets.

Although ARM mainly design CPUs, there is still a large amount of diversity within their product range.
In 1997, the company expanded into memory, video and I/O controllers to support the processors.
Latest processors can be found in a range of devices, from $mm^{3}$ sized devices, to $km^{3}$ sized. 
ARM is also currently expanding into the microserver market.
This related diversity, although in very similar areas, resulted in ARM being a resounding success.
