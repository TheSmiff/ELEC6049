\subsect{Reflection on Common Themes}
The full content of the invited talks is given in Appendix 5. 
The shorter summaries given in this section have highlighted some elements of common strategy.
Each of these companies started with a technological core focus.
This technical excellence or key innovation often has an integral role in the early company stages.
However, these companies are now well established and have since expanded and diversified into new areas.
These new markets and products are often related to the core technical competence of the initial business.
This allows the company to exploit their core competencies in other markets, increasing the profit potential of the company.
With these thoughts in mind, Section 2 examines further case studies of established companies to build a body of evidence for the claim that related diversification is the key to profitability.
