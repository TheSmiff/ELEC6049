1.0	&	Chair	&	The group decided that TJS should be the chair for this report. Both HSL and AJR are currently pursuing job applications, hence the logical choice that TJS be chair for this report. 	&   -	 \\ \hline
2.0	&	Case Study Ideas	&	TJS presented some ideas previously undertaken in a management module regarding Bowman's Strategy Clock, and the different strategies employed in the tablet market. The group discussed this as a case study and agreed it was interesting but obvious, but struggled to make a hypothesis. Discussions of reputation (Apple) and quality.	&-	 \\ \hline
3.0	&	Hypothesis 1	& HSL discussed Reputation - Companies such as Intel, Apple, Microsoft rely on their reputation as an established brand to sell their products. AJR proposed quality along the same lines.  & - \\ \hline
3.1	&	Hypothesis 2	& The group discussed collaboration in the context of ARM being fabless which enabled it to be more agile than Intel in the microprocessor market. AJR highlighted that ARM and Xilinix collaborate in the microprocessor and FPGA markets. Hypothesis is that by collaborating, established companies make money by reducing and spreading risks across multiple entities. Apple is an example contradicting the hypothesis. &	- \\ \hline
3.2	& Hypothesis 3 & TJS proposed that smart diversification was how an established company makes money. The group discussed Apple as an example with the iPhone, iPad and Mac ranges. Also Google with the search engine at the core, and Chrome and Android as diversification. Amazon with the online store at the core, and the Kindle e-reader and tablet as smart diversification along the same theme. A quick look in a textbook shows that this is called ``Related Diversification''. Microsoft with OSs and XBox. The group agreed that this was a possible hypothesis. &- \\ \hline
3.3 & Hypothesis selection & The group narrowed it down to collaboration or diversification as a topic. TJS chose to head toward the diversification hypothesis due to the strength and number of case studies. & \textbf{ALL A1.0} \textbf{All A3.0} \\ \hline
4.0 & Milestones & The group agreed to meet again on the \textbf{11th Feb} and that by then, most research should be complete, report stubs should be started and a clear hypothesis should be sought. The next meeting will be to put what we have together into a plan and to allocate work to complete the report by the tutorial on \textbf{18th Feb}. & \textbf{TJS A2.0} \\ \hline

1.0	&	House Keeping	&	HSL identified and addendum to the minutes of the last meeting and has corrected the typo. 
						Subsequent to this the minutes of the last meeting were adopted by the group								&	- \\ \hline
2.0	&	Tutorial Session	&	TJS attended the non-official tutorial session with Chris Freeman (CF). 
						TJS fed back to the group that CF had been very positive regarding the hypothesis proposed. 
						CF said it looked like a good report with good examples to back it up, the ideas were received with considerable enthusiasm. 
						CF highlighted the importance of good and appropriate referencing which should be heeded.						&	- \\ \hline
3.0	&	Research Progress	&	HSL provided some initial reading on Google, Amazon and Apple with particular emphasis on ZDnet article.
						AJR questioned if this is a credible source. 
						The group agreed it is important to follow reference trails through literature to establish the original source.			 &	- \\ \hline
4.0	&	Report Progress	&	TJS has drafted an introduction to the report and written the Domino Printing section. 
						The group read the report so far. 														 & 	   \\
4.1     &        				&	HSL noted that IEEE allows you to refer to numbered references as nouns, which the group agreed should be followed despite the report not being explicitly IEEE style.  &	\textbf{TJS A4.0} \\ 
4.2	&				&	HSL suggested moving the introductions from the start of each section to the introduction of the report - Actioned.		&\\
4.3	&				&	TJS proposed that the Domino Printing case study should be used as a template - Agreed by the group.				&	   \\
4.4	&				&	The group decided on three or potentially four case studies for section 2. 
						Google was chosen as an example of related diversification. 
						It was mentioned in the previous meeting as an example. 
						Atmel was also suggested, and HSL has some insider experience in this area hence justifying the choice. 
						Intel were discussed by the group. 
						Their failure to diversify into mobile must have caused some damage. 
						This will make a good study of a company that has remained relatively specialised. 
						Finally another company on the other end of the spectrum will be chosen. 
						Virgin Group was discussed with operations in finance, travel, space exploration and just about everything. 
						Mitsibushi were also discussed, with unrelated diversification spanning power equipment, cars and nuclear power stations. 
						One of these conglomerate organisations will also form a comparison for section 2. 
						The group agreed that the case studies should be written by the next tutorial, so that then the report could be collated into a coherent document.			&  \textbf{TJS A5.0 \& A8.0, AJR A6.0, HSL A7.0} \\
4.5	&				&	HSL mentioned that the group should break up the \TeX files. 										&  \textbf{HSL A9.0}	 \\ \hline
5.0	&	Remaining Talks	& 	The team agreed that HSL and AJR will take responsibility for one of the remaining invited talks each. 
						This includes keeping lecture notes in the appendix of the report and writing the relevant subsection in section 1.			& \textbf{AJR A10.0, HSL A11.0} \\ \hline
6.0	&	Minutes		&	The group agreed that TJS would collate these minutes.											& \textbf{TJS A12.0} \\ \hline
7.0	&	AOB			&	The next meeting will take place at the tutorial. The meeting was closed. & - \\ \hline

						All to read it a bit and review, HSL to condense.												&  \textbf{ALL A7.0} \\ \hline
5.0	&	Google Discussion	&	The group discussed the Google case study by TJS.
