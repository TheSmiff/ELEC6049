\subsect{Google Inc.}
Google Inc. was founded in 1998 \cite{google:timeline} by Larry Page and Sergey Brin based on their work carried out at Stanford University \cite{brin1998anatomy}. From humble beginnings as a search engine provider, Google has grown to dominate 70\% of the online search and advertisement industry \cite{rothrmel2013strategic} and has interests in a wide field of software applications \cite{wheelen2012strategic}. Google is one of the world's most valuable companies, with a market capital value of \$212.4bn \cite{FT500}. Google has successfully moved into areas as diverse as email, office software, geographical software, operating systems, mobile hardware and intelligent systems \cite{rothrmel2013strategic, wheelen2012strategic}. The success of these ventures can be attributed to consistently outperforming competitors with their core internet search services \cite{wheelen2012strategic}, which allows diversification to be based upon a renewal and reapplication of well-proven concepts.
